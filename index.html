                  The fires of 2014 seemed to be a continuation of the 2012 and 2013 fire seasons. Firefighters had no real down time between the fall fires of 2013 and the unprecedented rash of fires on the Oregon coast in January, 2014. During these incidents, Oregon firefighters were engaged in full wildland fire suppression activities only four days into the new year.

                  When it did rain in February and March, the weather brought disaster to a neighborhood near Oso, Washington where emergency responders, usually called for fires, were on the ground to assist. Washington Department of Natural Resources incident management teams responded to coordinate rescue operations, along with many DNR and other agency employees, local firefighters, and volunteers.

                  On the East Side, the rains triggered a drastic increase in fine wildfire fuels with a flush of grass and wildflower growth that created an unbroken, highly flammable carpet beneath trees and brush.

                  Our current wildland fuels problem has developed slowly over many years. Forests are denser and gaps normally seen in the drier forests have filled in so fire can spread unimpeded. Vegetation has grown into the spaces that once separated fire on the forest floor from the treetops. In the desert, invasive species have created a continuous carpet of highly flammable grasses where bunch grasses once grew in clumps with space between them.

                  In the past several decades, homes and businesses have spread into wildlands creating the wildland urban interface (WUI) where buildings and people intermingle with or boarder on flammable wildland vegetation. Buildings, woodpiles, propane tanks, vehicles, and the like add to fuels. Human life at risk adds to the complexity of firefighting and preparation.

                  The Pacific Northwest Coordinating Group can call upon well-staffed, equipped, and trained firefighters from local, state, and federal governments and on highly skilled private, commercial firefighters. When those resources are committed, more firefighters can be brought in from other states and even other countries if needed.

                  The Northwest Interagency Coordination Center provides logistical support and intelligence for anticipated and on-going wildfires for all federal and state agencies in the Pacific Northwest. The center also supports emergencies other than wildfires such as floods, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes.

                  <p>
                  Region-wide planning and coordination are provided by expert fire and emergency management staffs of the agencies that are part of the Pacific Northwest Wildfire Coordinating Group.

                  Climate controls fire to a large degree. The wet western side of the Cascades burns less often than the dry east side. Historically, coastal forests burned only once every 200-400 years. East side dry pine forests may have burned as often as every five years.

                  The severity of the 2014 fire season in the region was predicted early, said Bobbie Scopa, Deputy Regional Fire Director for the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service in Oregon and Washington. "There was a dry fall and winter with little precipitation. It's not like when it's wet in the fall and the fuels are wet going into the winter freeze. Fuels were dry all winter. We were getting large fires on the coast in January."

                  A key element of the preparedness decision-making process was pre-positioning of resources as fire conditions worsened. "We had extra engines, dozers, hand crews, and initial attack crews from back east. We got extra helicopters to units with special severity funding. We had 14 or 16 single engine air tankers across the geographic area almost the entire summer when we normally have four,” reports Scopa “There were three water scooping air tankers, three or four air tankers at Moses Lake, two or three at Redmond, and two or three at Medford. These were supplemented by aircraft from Boise, Idaho and by the DC-10 jet air tanker until it was needed for fires in northern California."

A long-term plan was developed to train and staff several prevention teams in the region. These prevention teams were able to address the immediate threat of human-caused fires by reinforcing established fire prevention programs throughout the region.

                    At 10:37am on Saturday, March 22, 2014, a massive landslide swept through the Stillaguamish Valley and through the community of Oso, WA, burying hundreds of acres and dozens of homes. The Northwest Washington Incident Management Team was requested by the City of Arlington and Snohomish County to assist in organizing and managing the search and rescue effort for potential survivors of this unfathomable incident.

                  On rangelands and in dryer forests east of the Cascades, spring rains broke the drought long enough for grasses, wildflowers, and other low growing vegetation to put on significant growth. As weather dried out again the lush vegetation cured to a highly flammable, continuous carpet beneath the sagebrush and trees. When lightning ignited wildfires in July and hot, dry winds blew, fires spread quickly. The Buzzard Complex on rangelands 45 miles southeast of Burns, Oregon burned 395,747 acres, most of it in one intense day.

                    Weather extremes that led to fires in January on the normally wet Oregon Coast and a deadly landslide triggered by intense rains characterize the 2014 fire season. Later, the unprecedented one-day run of the Carlton Complex fires that burned 400 square miles and more than 300 homes will be followed by intense rains that flood fire camp, wash away roads, and endanger firefighters.
                    <br><br>
                    If experiences with wildfires since the turn of the century suggest a “new normal”, perhaps we should expect more complex fires seasons rather than longer, dryer, hotter fire seasons. Perhaps the new normal is characterized more by weather patterns for which we are not prepared, including more extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum.

Although wind speed was estimated at less than 20 miles per hour, its direction aligned perfectly with fuels, says Craig Lenz, fire staff officer for the Deschutes-Ochoco National Forest and

                  During its run, the fire burned past suburbs of nearby Bend, and was stopped just short of the Skyliners Road neighborhood the second day. Still, 250 to 350 homes were evacuated, and many more were on alert. "The wind was mostly from the north," says Letz. "If the wind had shifted more to the west, we would have had more of a problem."

                  For its behavior and size, the Two Bulls Fire was very early in the season, says Oregon Department of Forestry Central Oregon District Forester, George Ponte. "Watching the ongoing drought situation in May, the district was probably on course to at least as difficult a season as 2013."

                  <p>
                   "The fire came before we officially entered fire season, and we didn't have the staffing we would have had later on in the season," Ponte notes.

                  The Awbrey Hall Fire burned in August and the Two Bulls Fire burned in early June. The fact that both fires burned with similar intensities and rates-of-spread demonstrates how serious fire conditions were at the beginning of the 2014 wildfire season. The Two Bulls Fire validated the Pacific Northwest Wildfire Coordinating Group’s early preparations.

                  It was not long before a series of lightning storms provided ignitions beyond firefighters’ fears. Officials suspect arsonists caused the Two Bulls Fire. Human-caused fires continued to plague hard pressed firefighters. People also started the 36 Pit Fire, last of the large fires of the season. But the 2014 fire season was powered mostly by lightning.

                  Ponte and Letz agree the relationships between federal agencies and the state departments of forestry are outstanding. "Simulations, exercises, and after season reviews all help," Ponte says. "I would hold the model we have here in Central Oregon against any model in the U.S. We've fought a lot of fire together and learned a lot of lessons."
                  <br><br>
                  "We work a lot with ODF, the Bend Fire Department, the Deschutes County Sheriff, and the Bend Police Department," says Letz. "Everybody was at the command post right away. It was just after a pre-season cooperator's meeting. Everybody knew each other and what their jobs were."
                  <br><br>
                  "When you roll up to a fire, everyone is really comfortable," Letz adds. "Folks were ready...it was key to us being successful."

                  The Two Bulls fire reminded many Bend residents and firefighters of the 1990 Awbrey Hall Fire. Both fires burned west of town and threatened neighborhoods. Both made six-mile runs through brush and ponderosa pine. But the Awbrey Hall Fire burned 22 homes and the Two Bulls Fire burned none. Defensible space helped make the difference.
                  <br><br>
                  After the 1996 Skeleton Fire burned 17,000 acres in Bend and destroyed 19 homes, Bend’s Fire Marshal, Gary Marshall, developed FireFree. With financial help from Safeco Insurance, local businesses, fire agencies, and private citizens, FireFree launched a campaign to promote a simple 10-step program for fire hazard mitigation around homes.  
                  <br><br>
                    This was an early, successful effort to engage neighborhoods in wildfire preparedness and mitigation. Local projects like FireFree in Bend ultimately demonstrated the potential for citizen-based community wildfire protection and blazed the path to national programs like FireWise and Fire Adapted Communities.  http://www.firefree.org

                The state of Oregon has an aggressive Firewise program helping communities and landowners minimize risks from wildfire. Although the Twin Bulls fire was stopped before nearby Firewise practices were test-ed, there were benefits from past work done, Ponte and Letz agree.
                <br><br>
                "On the very south end of the fire the Deschutes and Ochoco National Forests had done a lot of fuel reduction work in the past and the Skyliners Road neighborhood had instituted a tremendous amount of Firewise practices," Letz says. "We were feeling pretty comfortable about being able to catch the fire if it got that far."
