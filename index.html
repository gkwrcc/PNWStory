                <p>
                The fires of 2014 seemed to be a continuation of the fires of 2012 and 2013.
                There was hardly a pause between the fall fires of 2013 and the unprecedented rash of fires on the Oregon coast in January.
                Oregon firefighters were engaged only 4 days into the new year.  
                </p>

                <p>
                Even when it rained in February and March,
                the weather brought disaster to a neighborhood near Oso, Washington.
                Washington Department of Natural Resources incident management teams responded to manage the recovery operations along with many DNR employees, local firefighters, and volunteers.
                </p>

                <p>
                On the East Side,
                the rains triggered a flush of grass and wildflower growth that spread an unbroken,
                highly flammable carpet beneath the brush.  
                </p>

                <p>
                Oregon’s largest fire on record exploded through the dry grass.
                The fire grew so large, mostly in one day,
                that the perimeter exceeded the freeway distance from Yreka, California to Portland, Oregon.
                </p>

                <p>
                On the same day, in Eastern Washington,
                that state’s largest ever fire burned more than 300 homes, devastating

        <h2 class="text-center">Rare wildfires burn in January</h2>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>
                For the <abbr title="Pacific Northwest Coordinating Group">PNWCG</abbr>,
                the January fires predicted a serious 2014 wildfire season that would start early.
                They took precautions to prepare that proved wise as the 2014 wildfire season unfolded.
                </p>
                <p>
                Four days into the New Year, the first official wildfire of 2014 ignited when fires used to burn limbs and other logging slash escaped.  The wildfire burned 549 acres near the Oregon coast and cost almost $300,000 to control.  
                </p>
                <p>
                On January 22, the National Weather Service issued a
                <a href="http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/" data-toggle="tooltip"
                    title="Click for more information on Red Flag Warnings"
                    style="white-space: nowrap;">Red Flag Warning</a>
                for Southwest Oregon because of low relative humidity and east winds.  A Red Flag warning alerts wildland fire managers to weather conditions that could result in fire starts and cause fires to burn hot, spread rapidly, or behave erratically. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Over the next two days, escaped slash burns throughout western Oregon burned over 1,000 acres. In all, 21 January wildfires burned more than 1,600 acres in Oregon. The 10-year average (ODF) for the month of January is 17 acres burned.
                </p>

                <p>
                The severity of the 2014 fire season in the region was predicted early, said Bobbie Scopa, Deputy Regional Fire Director for the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service in Oregon and Washington.   "There was a dry fall and winter with little precipitation.   It's not like when it's wet in the fall and the fuels are wet into the winter freeze.  Fuels were dry all winter.  We were getting large fires on the coast in January." 
                </p>

                <p>
                The decision was made early to ramp up preparedness levels of fire fighting resources as the fire season developed.  The BLM, Forest Service, Oregon Department of Forestry and Washington Department of Natural Resources were all agreed.  "Nationally, people were supportive of our plans...they saw the same things we did."
                </p>

                <p>
                A key element of preparedness decisions was pre-positioning of resources as fire conditions worsened.  "We had extra engines, dozers, hand crews, and initial attack crews from back east.  We got extra helicopters to units with severity dollars.  We had 14 or 16 single engine air tankers across the geographic area almost the entire summer when we normally have four.  There were three water scooping air tankers, three or four air tankers at Moses Lake, two or three at Redmond, and two or three at Medford.   These were supplemented by aircraft from Boise, Idaho and by the DC-10 jet air tanker until it was needed for fires in northern California."
                </p>

                <h3>National Fire Prevention Teams ordered.</h3>
                <p>
                To counteract the increased threat of human-caused wildfires during the approaching season, the PNWCG ordered a National Wildland Fire Prevention Team.  The team’s assignment was to support the prevention efforts of field units and to build fire prevention capacity.  Capacity building included increasing the number of prevention personnel in the Pacific Northwest qualified to serve on or lead fire prevention teams.
                </p>

                <p>
                The first National Fire Prevention and Education Team arrived on June 16.  The last team left on September 26. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Work began with an assessment of human causes of wildfires across the region.  Ignitions were mapped.  Field visits and telephone interviews documented the human-caused fire problems.  The current fire prevention programs were described.  Communication needs and networks were identified. Community concerns described.
                </p>

                <p>
                A twitter account and website were developed to enhance communication among field units and to disseminate communication materials and practices.  Prevention products were developed and distributed to the field.  An outreach to partners in collaborative programs was implemented.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Prevention capacity was developed though involvement of personnel from the region on the prevention teams.  A long-term plan was developed to train and staff several prevention teams in the region.   The prevention teams were able to address the immediate threat of human-caused fires by reinforcing established fire prevention programs throughout the region.  Capacity building efforts will leave the region better prepared to cope with emerging human-caused wildfire threats in future years.
