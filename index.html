                  The fires of 2014 seemed to be a continuation of the 2012 and 2013 fire seasons. Firefighters had no real down time between the fall fires of 2013 and the unprecedented rash of fires on the Oregon coast in January, 2014. During these incidents, Oregon firefighters were engaged in full wildland fire suppression activities only four days into the new year.

                  When it did rain in February and March, the weather brought disaster to a neighborhood near Oso, Washington where emergency responders, usually called for fires, were on the ground to assist. Washington Department of Natural Resources incident management teams responded to coordinate rescue operations, along with many DNR and other agency employees, local firefighters, and volunteers.

                  On the East Side, the rains triggered a drastic increase in fine wildfire fuels with a flush of grass and wildflower growth that created an unbroken, highly flammable carpet beneath trees and brush.

                  Our current wildland fuels problem has developed slowly over many years. Forests are denser and gaps normally seen in the drier forests have filled in so fire can spread unimpeded. Vegetation has grown into the spaces that once separated fire on the forest floor from the treetops. In the desert, invasive species have created a continuous carpet of highly flammable grasses where bunch grasses once grew in clumps with space between them.

                  In the past several decades, homes and businesses have spread into wildlands creating the wildland urban interface (WUI) where buildings and people intermingle with or boarder on flammable wildland vegetation. Buildings, woodpiles, propane tanks, vehicles, and the like add to fuels. Human life at risk adds to the complexity of firefighting and preparation.

                  The Pacific Northwest Coordinating Group can call upon well-staffed, equipped, and trained firefighters from local, state, and federal governments and on highly skilled private, commercial firefighters. When those resources are committed, more firefighters can be brought in from other states and even other countries if needed.

                  The Northwest Interagency Coordination Center provides logistical support and intelligence for anticipated and on-going wildfires for all federal and state agencies in the Pacific Northwest. The center also supports emergencies other than wildfires such as floods, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes.

                  <p>
                  Region-wide planning and coordination are provided by expert fire and emergency management staffs of the agencies that are part of the Pacific Northwest Wildfire Coordinating Group.

                  Climate controls fire to a large degree. The wet western side of the Cascades burns less often than the dry east side. Historically, coastal forests burned only once every 200-400 years. East side dry pine forests may have burned as often as every five years.

                  The fall of 2013 was considerably drier than normal.  In January on the Oregon coast, it hardly rained at all.  Normally the coast experiences rain on two out of three days during January.  More than 10 inches of rain typically fall in the month.

                  The severity of the 2014 fire season in the region was predicted early, said Bobbie Scopa, Deputy Regional Fire Director for the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service in Oregon and Washington. "There was a dry fall and winter with little precipitation. It's not like when it's wet in the fall and the fuels are wet going into the winter freeze. Fuels were dry all winter. We were getting large fires on the coast in January."

                  A key element of the preparedness decision-making process was pre-positioning of resources as fire conditions worsened. "We had extra engines, dozers, hand crews, and initial attack crews from back east. We got extra helicopters to units with special severity funding. We had 14 or 16 single engine air tankers across the geographic area almost the entire summer when we normally have four,” reports Scopa “There were three water scooping air tankers, three or four air tankers at Moses Lake, two or three at Redmond, and two or three at Medford. These were supplemented by aircraft from Boise, Idaho and by the DC-10 jet air tanker until it was needed for fires in northern California."

A long-term plan was developed to train and staff several prevention teams in the region. These prevention teams were able to address the immediate threat of human-caused fires by reinforcing established fire prevention programs throughout the region.

                    At 10:37am on Saturday, March 22, 2014, a massive landslide swept through the Stillaguamish Valley and through the community of Oso, WA, burying hundreds of acres and dozens of homes. The Northwest Washington Incident Management Team was requested by the City of Arlington and Snohomish County to assist in organizing and managing the search and rescue effort for potential survivors of this unfathomable incident.

                  On rangelands and in dryer forests east of the Cascades, spring rains broke the drought long enough for grasses, wildflowers, and other low growing vegetation to put on significant growth. As weather dried out again the lush vegetation cured to a highly flammable, continuous carpet beneath the sagebrush and trees. When lightning ignited wildfires in July and hot, dry winds blew, fires spread quickly. The Buzzard Complex on rangelands 45 miles southeast of Burns, Oregon burned 395,747 acres, most of it in one intense day.

                    Weather extremes that led to fires in January on the normally wet Oregon Coast and a deadly landslide triggered by intense rains characterize the 2014 fire season. Later, the unprecedented one-day run of the Carlton Complex fires that burned 400 square miles and more than 300 homes will be followed by intense rains that flood fire camp, wash away roads, and endanger firefighters.
                    <br><br>
                    If experiences with wildfires since the turn of the century suggest a “new normal”, perhaps we should expect more complex fires seasons rather than longer, dryer, hotter fire seasons. Perhaps the new normal is characterized more by weather patterns for which we are not prepared, including more extreme weather on both ends of the spectrum.
