                <p>
                The fires of 2014 seemed to be a continuation of the 2012 and 2013 fire seasons.
                Firefighters had no real down time between the fall fires of 2013
                and the unprecedented rash of fires on the Oregon coast in January, 2014.
                During these incidents,
                Oregon firefighters were engaged in full wildland fire suppression activities only four days into the new year.
                </p>

                <p>
                When it did rain in February and March,
                the weather brought disaster to a neighborhood near Oso, Washington where emergency responders,
                usually called for fires, were on the ground to assist.
                Washington Department of Natural Resources incident management teams responded to coordinate rescue operations,
                along with many DNR and other agency employees, local firefighters,
                and <a data-toggle="popover" data-html="true"

                <p>
                On the East Side,
                the rains triggered a drastic increase in fine wildfire fuels
                with a flush of grass and wildflower growth that created an unbroken,
                highly flammable carpet beneath trees and brush.
                </p>

                <p>
                Oregon’s largest fire on record exploded through the High Desert brush
                and dry grass on private and BLM-protected lands near Burns.
                The fire grew so large, mostly in one day,
                the perimeter exceeded the freeway distance from Yreka, California to Portland, Oregon.
                </p>

                <p>
                On the same day in Eastern Washington,
                the state’s largest ever wildfire started.
                It burned more than 300 homes,
                devastating local communities and the natural environment which draws people to live and recreate in the area.

                Four days into the New Year,
                the first official wildfire of 2014 ignited when conditions caused the escape of fires meant to reduce fuels
                by burning limbs and other logging slash.
                The first wildfire burned 549 acres near the Oregon coast,
                and cost almost $300,000 to control.

                for Southwest Oregon because of low relative humidity and east winds.
                A Red Flag warning alerts wildland fire managers to weather conditions that could result in fire starts
                and cause fires to burn hot, spread rapidly, or behave erratically.
                </p>

                <p>
                Over the next two days,
                escaped slash burns throughout western Oregon burned over 1,000 acres.
                In all, 21 January wildfires burned more than 1,600 acres in Oregon.
                The 10-year average (ODF) for the month of January is 17 acres burned.

                The severity of the 2014 fire season in the region was predicted early,
                said Bobbie Scopa,
                Deputy Regional Fire Director for the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service in Oregon and Washington.
                "There was a dry fall and winter with little precipitation.  
                It's not like when it's wet in the fall and the fuels are wet into the winter freeze. 
                Fuels were dry all winter. 
                We were getting large fires on the coast in January." 
                </p>

                <p>
                The decision was made early to ramp up preparedness

                of fire fighting resources as the fire season developed.  The BLM, Forest Service, Oregon Department of Forestry and Washington Department of Natural Resources were all agreed.  "Nationally, people were supportive of our plans...they saw the same things we did."
                </p>

                <p>
                A key element of preparedness decisions was pre-positioning of resources as fire conditions worsened. 
                "We had extra engines, dozers, hand crews, and initial attack crews from back east. 
                We got extra helicopters to units with severity dollars. 
                We had 14 or 16 single engine air tankers across the geographic area almost the entire summer when we normally have four. 
                There were three water scooping air tankers,
                three or four air tankers at Moses Lake,
                two or three at Redmond, and two or three at Medford.  
                These were supplemented by aircraft from Boise, Idaho
                and by the DC-10 jet air tanker until it was needed for fires in northern California."

                    PNWCG</a>
                ordered a National Wildland Fire Prevention Team.
                The team’s assignment was to support the prevention efforts of field units and to build fire prevention capacity. 
                Capacity building included increasing the number of prevention personnel in the Pacific Northwest qualified to serve on or lead fire prevention teams.

                National Fire Prevention and Education Team</a>
                arrived on June 16.  The last team left on September 26.  
                </p>

                <p>
                Work began with an assessment of human causes of wildfires across the region.  Ignitions were mapped.  Field visits and telephone interviews documented the human-caused fire problems.  The current fire prevention programs were described.  Communication needs and networks were identified. Community concerns described.
                </p>

                <p>
                A twitter account and website were developed to enhance communication among field units and to disseminate communication materials and practices.  Prevention products were developed and distributed to the field.  An outreach to partners in collaborative programs was implemented.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Prevention capacity was developed though involvement of personnel from the region on the prevention teams.  A long-term plan was developed to train and staff several prevention teams in the region.   The prevention teams were able to address the immediate threat of human-caused fires by reinforcing established fire prevention programs throughout the region.  Capacity building efforts will leave the region better prepared to cope with emerging human-caused wildfire threats in future years.
